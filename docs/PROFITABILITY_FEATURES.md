### 2. 🎯 **Automatic Risk/Reward Calculation**

```
AI: "💰 PROFITABILITY ANALYSIS:

📊 Bitcoin (BTC) - Profitability Score: 78/100 (Excellent ⭐)

🎯 TRADING PLAN:
- Entry: $43,000 (Reason: Near support with RSI oversold)
- Stop Loss: $42,100 (Risk: 2.1%)
- Target 1: $43,860 (+2%) - Take 50% profit here, move stop to breakeven
- Target 2: $44,720 (+4%) - Take 30% profit here, trail stop-loss

```
