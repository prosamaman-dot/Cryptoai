## 🐛 Known Issues to Watch For

1. **WebSocket Connection:**
   - May fail initially (expected)
   - Should automatically fallback to REST API
   - Look for: `🔄 Starting REST API fallback...`

2. **CORS Issues:**
   - If Binance API blocked: Fallback should still work
   - Check console for fetch errors

3. **Ticker Animation:**
   - Should be smooth even with CPU throttling
   - If jerky: Check performance.css is loaded

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

The application is considered **fully functional** if:

1. ✅ Users can signup and stay logged in after refresh
2. ✅ All error messages are clearly visible
3. ✅ Ticker scrolls smoothly and prices update
4. ✅ No critical console errors (WebSocket errors are OK if fallback works)
5. ✅ Chat responds with AI messages
6. ✅ Portfolio management works
7. ✅ Mobile responsive layout works
