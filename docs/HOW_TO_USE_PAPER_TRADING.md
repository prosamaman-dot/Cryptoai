# 🎮 How to Use Paper Trading

## Quick Start Guide

Paper Trading lets you **practice trading with virtual $10,000** - no real money at risk!

---

## 📖 Step-by-Step Tutorial

### **Step 1: Open Paper Trading Dashboard**

1. Open your website
2. Click the **Features button** (grid icon in top-right)
3. Click **"🎮 Paper Trading"** card
4. Dashboard opens showing:
   - Virtual Balance: $10,000.00
   - Paper Positions: (empty at start)

---

### **Step 2: Get a Trading Signal from AI**

In the chat, say:
```
Scan the market
```

AI will respond with something like:
```
🚀 I scanned 30 top coins and found the best setup!

🏆 I got Bitcoin - it has the perfect setup to trade right now!

💰 THE TRADE SETUP:
📍 Entry: $43,250.00
🎯 Target 1: $45,100.00 (+4.3%)
🎯 Target 2: $47,500.00 (+9.8%)
🛡️ Stop Loss: $42,100.00 (-2.7%)
💵 Position Size: $300.00 (3% of your USDT)
```

---

### **Step 3: Execute Paper Trade**

**Option A: Use Chat Command (Easy!)**

In the chat, type:
```
paper trade bitcoin 0.1 at 43250
```

Format: `paper trade [coin] [amount] at [price]`

Examples:
- `paper trade ethereum 2 at 2300`
- `paper trade solana 10 at 100`
- `paper trade btc 0.5 at 43250`

**Option B: Manual Method**

If auto-trading isn't set up yet, simply:
1. Note the entry price from AI signal
2. Calculate how many coins you want (e.g., $300 ÷ $43,250 = 0.0069 BTC)
3. Remember this mentally or write it down
4. When price hits target or stop, calculate profit

---

### **Step 4: Track Your Position**

1. Open **Paper Trading Dashboard**
2. See your active positions:

```
╔════════════════════════════════════════╗
║ BTC                           [Close]  ║

║ +$125.50  (+4.3%)                     ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

---

### **Step 5: Close Position (Take Profit or Stop Loss)**

1. Open Paper Trading Dashboard
2. Click **[Close]** button next to position

## 💰 **Position Sizing Tips**

Use AI's recommended position size (3% rule):
- $10,000 balance × 3% = $300 per trade
- Keeps risk manageable
- Allows 10+ trades even if some lose

Or calculate yourself:
```
Position Size = Balance × Risk%
$10,000 × 3% = $300
```

Then:
```
Amount = Position Size ÷ Price
$300 ÷ $100 = 3 coins
```
