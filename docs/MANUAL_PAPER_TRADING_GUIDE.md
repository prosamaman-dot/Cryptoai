## 🧮 Position Sizing Calculator

**Formula:**
```
Amount = (Balance × Risk%) ÷ Price
```

**Example:**
```
Balance: $10,000
Risk: 3% (recommended)
Price: $100

Amount = ($10,000 × 0.03) ÷ $100
       = $300 ÷ $100
       = 3 coins
```

## 🚨 Common Mistakes

### ❌ **No Stop Loss**
Without SL, one bad trade can wipe you out!

### ❌ **Too Much Risk**
Using 100% balance on one trade = gambling

### ❌ **No Take Profit**
Greed is dangerous. Lock profits!

### ❌ **Ignoring Live Prices**
Price updates every 2 seconds - watch them!

### ❌ **FOMO Trading**
Just because price is moving doesn't mean enter
